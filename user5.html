                 <p><strong>River:Yamuna</strong>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong>The Yamuna River, once a symbol of beauty and life, has now become a haunting reflection of neglect and despair. Growing up in Delhi, Iâ€™ve always cherished the banks of this river, where countless memories were made. But the reality today is heartbreaking.

                    Pollution has taken its toll on the Yamuna. Industrial waste, sewage, and garbage have transformed its waters into a toxic mix, endangering the ecosystem and the livelihoods of those living along its banks. The once-clear waters, which once nourished our lands, are now a murky reminder of our disregard for nature.
                    
                    This situation isn't just about the river; it affects the people who rely on it. Health issues are rampant in communities that depend on the Yamuna for water and sustenance. We cannot sit back and watch as this vital resource is destroyed.
                    
                    It's time for us to rise, to raise our voices against this injustice. We need stricter regulations, effective waste management, and a collective commitment to restoring the Yamuna to its former glory. Together, we can bring life back to this river, ensuring that future generations can enjoy its beauty and bounty.</p>
