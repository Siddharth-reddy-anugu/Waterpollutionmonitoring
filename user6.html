                <h2>Thalapathy</h2>
                <p><strong>State:Tamilnadu</strong> </p>
                 <p><strong>River:Cooum</strong>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> As Thalapathy, I feel a deep connection to the land and its rivers. The Cooum River, flowing through Tamil Nadu, has become a shadow of its former self. Once a lifeline for many, it now faces severe pollution, threatening the ecosystem and the communities relying on it.

                    In recent years, industrial waste and untreated sewage have turned the river into a dumping ground. The vibrant life that once thrived in its waters is diminishing, leading to a decline in fish populations and biodiversity. This pollution not only affects the river but also poses health risks to the local population, as many depend on its waters for daily activities.
                    
                    It's crucial that we unite as a community to raise awareness about the Cooum River's plight. Together, we must advocate for stricter regulations, improved waste management, and community initiatives to restore the river to its former glory. The Cooum River deserves better, and itâ€™s our responsibility to protect it for future generations.
                    
                    Let us not forget the beauty and importance of our rivers, for they are the veins of our land.</p>
