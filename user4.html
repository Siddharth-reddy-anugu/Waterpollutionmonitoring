                 <p><strong>River:Subarnarekha</strong>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> I grew up alongside the Subarnarekha River, witnessing its enchanting beauty and the way it intertwined with our lives. This river has been a lifeline for our community, providing water for drinking, irrigation, and countless cherished moments spent on its banks. However, the reality today is disheartening.

                    Over the years, the Subarnarekha has suffered immensely due to pollution. Industrial effluents, untreated sewage, and plastic waste have choked its once-clear waters, transforming it into a dumping ground rather than a source of life. The local flora and fauna are bearing the brunt of this degradation, with many species at risk of extinction.
                    
                    Moreover, the pollution poses severe health risks to the communities that rely on the river for their daily needs. It’s painful to see my fellow villagers suffer from waterborne diseases because of the very resource that once nourished us.
                    
                    We must act now. It’s essential to raise awareness about the pollution affecting the Subarnarekha and advocate for stricter regulations on waste disposal. Community clean-up initiatives, proper waste management systems, and a collective commitment to preserving our natural resources can pave the way for a cleaner, healthier river.
                    
                    Let’s join hands to restore the Subarnarekha to its pristine state and ensure that it continues to flow with life for generations to come. Our river deserves better, and so do we.
